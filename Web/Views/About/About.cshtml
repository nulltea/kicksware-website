				Before we jump into the story behind creating and explanation of our purpose and goals the right thing to do
				will telling some essential information about us or you might say about me:
			</p>
			<p>
				My name is <strong>Timothy Yalugin</strong>. I'm a full stack software engineer specialised in
				designing, developing and serving complex scalable web apps and cloud solutions.
				I'm also moving towards System Architecture in my career path as it is my long-term goal for the future.
				As for today, I am in constant search of experience working with new diverse
				technologies, languages, workflows, and projects to gain fundamental knowledge for
				designing more complex, more secure, and more groundbreaking software infrastructure systems.
			</p>
			<div id="bio-trigger"></div>
			<p>
				If you happen to have a project that can interest me, please continue scrolling to the last section of this page.
				Otherwise, this all is about letting you know that exactly passion for creating, building, and discovering new
				was the main reason for <span class="kicksware">Kicksware</span> to exists.

				Same as any other new thing it all started as an idea (project idea) - building an app using microservice architecture.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're wondering the sense behind putting a few common words in such fancy new way this is not the right place for it.
				Although I might give you a hint - <a href="https://martinfowler.com/architecture/" target="_blank">“Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is”</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyway, the thing you should know is that all that you see here was created as part me discovering new technology and the
				need behind it. <em>So is it all about kicks or not?</em> Well yes it is, no matter it started as a study project afterwards
				I use my passion for sneakers as the soul of a future product.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result you have a web market platform such as <a href="https://www.stadiumgoods.com/" target="_blank">Stadium Goods</a>,
				<a href="https://www.grailed.com/" target="_blank">Grailed</a>,
				<a href="https://www.goat.com/" target="_blank">GOAT</a> or <a href="https://stockx.com/" target="_blank">StockX</a> and you know what?
				There are plenty more of these. So is there any difference and why should you care?
			</p>
			<p>
				Being a software developer taught me that no matter how many succeeded before you, but who of them provide <strong>better now</strong>.
				Let me tell you an example: in web development we have a shit-load of javascript frameworks that all do the same thing.
				However, every year we are witnessing the rise of new and the downfall of a predecessor. The same with programming languages,
				architectures and anything that have the potential to progress.
			</p>
			<p>
				And by saying this I don't mean this is the new main sneaker marketplace.
				Just consider trying new.

				The original goal of this campaign is actually already successfully achieved.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've discovered the crazy amount of new priceless knowledge that is not only useful now but also will become a core for the future projects.
				<br/>
				I've acquired skills of use and get to know plenty of new, crazy powerful technologies as well as architectures,
				design patterns and principles of web service and system development.
			</p>
			<p>
				So my work here can be called done. However, like any parent wants his child to have a better future,
				I also have a hope for <span class="kicksware">Kicksware</span> to become a thing.
			</p>
			<p>
				And I could use another hothead to level up the game. So if you have some ideas of how to take advantage of this
				well-designed, build and ready to use platform - feel free to contact with me and I hope together we'll make it work!
